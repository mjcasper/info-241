## What to Study

- **New Topics:**
    - Line Integrals: 1 question for each of LI1, LI2, LI4, LI5
    - Surface Integrals: 1 question for each of SI2, SI3, SI4

- **Old Topics:**
    - 2 questions from V1-V6
    - 1 question from VVF1-VVF6
    - 1 question from SVF1-SVF6
    - 1 question from O1-O4
    - 0 questions from DI1-DI3 (although double integrals will still show up in some form with Green's Theorem and Surface Integrals)
    - 1 question from TI1-TI4
    - 0 questions from VF1-VF6 (although some of these topics are indirectly tested with line and surface integrals)

- **Number of Questions:** 13 problems.
    - These will be similar in format to the Checkpoint Exam and previous Midterm Exam questions.
    - There will be one question per learning outcome (just like the Checkpoint Exams).
    - Some of the questions may only have you set up an integral, but not finish evaluating it.

- **Simplifying:** Unless otherwise stated on the exam, you do not need to simplify your answers.

## How To Study

The more problems you do, the better prepared you will be!

- **Midterm and Checkpoint Exams** - If one of your questions was marked incorrect, make sure you understand why. Go through your notes or the review video, find a similar example, and compare what we did there vs what you had on your exam.

- **Old Homework Problems** on WeBWork

- **In-Class Problems** - try the in-class problems we did in lecture and recitation. 

- **Lecture Examples** - try the examples we did in lecture: work on them by yourself and then use your notes or the review video to check your solution (not just your answer) or for help if you get stuck.

## Follow-up Opportunity

For any learning outcome still marked as Progressing on any Checkpoint Exam:

- If you score a 90% or better on a Final Exam question which tests the same learning outcome, you will earn (M) Meets Expectations for that learning outcome.
