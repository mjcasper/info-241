- **Student ID:** Bring either your UB Student ID or government issued ID.

 - **Calculator Policy:** Calculators are NOT allowed. _The exam questions are written so that a calculator is not needed._

- **References/resources policy:** No outside references/resources allowed during the exam.  The only references/resources allowed during the exam are those provided as part of the exam packet. 
    - No reference page will be provided.  A list will be provided on Monday, September 25th of the formula you should have memorized for the exam.

```{admonition} Formula to Memorize

1. Vector Equation for Line: $\vec{r}(t)=\vec{r}_0 + t \vec{v}$

1. Vector Equation for Plane: $\vec{n} \cdot \vec{r} =\vec{n} \cdot \vec{r}_0 $

1. Parametric Equations for a circle of radius $r$
1. Parametric Equations for a line segment between two points.

1. Length of a Curve: $L = \displaystyle \int_{a}^{b}\bigg | \vec{r}'(t) \bigg| dt$

1. Curvature: $\kappa(t)= \dfrac{|\vec{r}\, '(t)\times\vec{r}\, ''(t)||}{\vec{r}'(t)|^3}$

1. Unit Tangent: $\vec{T}(t)= \dfrac{\vec{r}'(t)}{|\vec{r}'(t)|}$

1. Unit Normal: $\vec{N}(t)= \dfrac{\vec{T}'(t)}{|\vec{T}'(t)|}$

1. Unit Binormal: $\vec{B}(t)=\vec{T}(t)\times \vec{N}(t) $

## What to Study

- **Topics:** learning outcomes V1-V6 and VVF1-VVF6

- **Number of Questions:** 12 problems.
    - These will be similar in format to the Checkpoint Exam questions.
    - There will be one question per learning outcome (just like the Checkpoint Exams).

- **Simplifying:** Unless otherwise stated on the exam, you do not need to simplify your answers.

## How To Study

The more problems you do, the better prepared you will be!

- **Checkpoint Exams** - If one of your questions was marked incorrect on Gradescope. Make sure you understand why. Go through your notes or the review video, find a similar example, and compare what we did there vs what you had on your exam.

- **Old Homework Problems** on WeBWork

- **In-Class Problems** - try the in-class problems we did in lecture and recitation. 

- **Lecture Examples** - try the examples we did in lecture: work on them by yourself and then use your notes or the review video to check your solution (not just your answer) or for help if you get stuck.

## Follow-up Opportunity

For any learning outcome still marked as Progressing on any Checkpoint Exam:

- If you score a 90% or better on a Midterm Exam 1 question which tests the same learning outcome, you will earn (M) Meets Expectations for that learning outcome.
