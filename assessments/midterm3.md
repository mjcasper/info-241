## How To Study

The more problems you do, the better prepared you will be!

- **Checkpoint Exams** - If one of your questions was marked incorrect on Gradescope. Make sure you understand why. Go through your notes or the review video, find a similar example, and compare what we did there vs what you had on your exam.

- **Old Homework Problems** on WeBWork

- **In-Class Problems** - try the in-class problems we did in lecture and recitation.

- **Lecture Examples** - try the examples we did in lecture: work on them by yourself and then use your notes or the review video to check your solution (not just your answer) or for help if you get stuck.

- If you score a 90% or better on a Midterm Exam 3 question which tests the same learning outcome, you will earn (M) Meets Expectations for that learning outcome.
