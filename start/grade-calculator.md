Letter Grade Calculator
============================


## Directions

Use your latest progress report to help provide the following estimates. Keep in mind that everyone gets 2 HW passes, 2 Notebook passes, and 6 participation passes for the semester.

- **Learning Checks**: 42 total possible learning checks for the semester.
- **Participation Checks**: 60 total possible participation checks for the semester.
- **Exam Scores**: Do not use the raw point total, calculate your exam scores out of 100 first.

## How do I improve my grade?

Don't like what you see above? As of week 13, there is still time to substantially improve your grade!

1. **Homework and Notebooks**: Keep working on any homework sets that you have not completed (both the WeBWorK problems and the notebooks).
2. **Participation**: Make sure you are regularly coming to lecture and recitation with the preparation videos completed and your written notes.
3. **Checkpoint Exams**: Keep practicing any of the learning outcomes that are still marked as (P) Progressing or (U) Unsatisfactory.
