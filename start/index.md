Syllabus and More
============================

In this section, you'll find the **course syllabus** and list of **learning outcomes** - please reference this as much as you need. If you have a question about the logistics of the course (grading or otherwise) you will most likely find the answer here. You can also use the **Search** feature in the left menu to help find what you're looking for.

We also include a short **Introduction to the WeBWorK** homework system, to help give you an idea of why we are using this - as well as some helpful tips and ways of submitting answers.

And the **Course App** is a fun way to quickly access all class material!
