## 3. Assessments

Your final grade will be determined by your performance on the following categories: Learning Checks, Participation, Midterm Exams, and the Cumulative Final Exam.

### 3.1. Learning Checks (25%)

```{include} ../info-components/03-learning-checks.md
```


#### 3.1.1. Homework

```{include} ../info-components/03-homework.md
```


#### 3.1.2. Homework Notebook Check

```{include} ../info-components/03-notebook.md
```


#### 3.1.3. Checkpoint Exams

```{include} ../info-components/03-checkpoint-exam.md
```

<!--
#### 3.1.4. Preparation
```{include} ../info-components/03-preparation.md
```
-->


### 3.2 Participation (10%)


Attendance and participation at each lecture and recitation section will be graded through in-class assignments. Each in-class activity will be graded as either (M) Meets Expectations or (P) Progressing. These in-class assignments are an early part of the learning process, so you will not necessarily be graded on full comprehension. Instead, you will usually be graded based on whether an honest attempt to answer the question(s) was made (using your notes from class and the preparation materials).

- **(M) Meets Expectations** indicates an honest attempt was made on your part to solve the problem(s) using your notes from class and preparation material.
- **(P) Progressing** means your work is insufficient based on what was presented in class and preparation material up to that point.



Your grade for the participation category will be calculated as the percentage of (M) Meets Expectations scores you earn on the combined total of in-class assignments.


> Everyone gets **4 Participation Passes** for the semester. Each individual pass grants you a score of (M) Meets Expectations on 1 in-class assignment. 
>
> - If you are absent one day, then a participation pass will be applied to each assignment you missed.

### 4.2. Letter Grade

```{include} ../info-components/04-letter-grade.md
```


### 4.3 Calculating Your Grade

Calculate your Learning Check score.
  1. Count how many learning checks you earned.
  2. Divide this by the total number of possible learning checks.
  3. Multiply this by 100.

Calculate your Participation score.
  1. Count how many participation checks you earned.
  2. Divide this by the total number of possible participation checks.
  3. Multiply this by 100.

Calculate your Final Average
  1. Multiply your Learning Check score by 0.25
  2. Multiply your Participation score by 0.10
  3. Multiply your Highest Midterm Exam score by 0.175
  4. Multiply your Middle Midterm Exam score by 0.125
  5. Multiply your Lowest Midterm Exam score by 0.10
  6. Multiply your Final Exam score by 0.25.
  7. Add these six values together, this is your Final Average.
