```{admonition} Tentative Pacing
:class: tip

Note that the pacing of the sections here is tentative. Some weeks we might go a little slower, other weeks we might go a little faster. The last two weeks are listed as review to add flexibility to our schedule in case we need to slow down on some topics.
